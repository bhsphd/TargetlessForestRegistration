# TargetlessForestRegistration
Targetless TLS data registration for forest scans. Algorithm by David Kelbe et al., implementation by me.

## Introduction
This program registers one forest scan to another using a "stem map" representing the position and DBH of each tree in a scan.
It does so using an algorithm designed by David Kelbe et al., which I've augmented mainly by reimplementing it in C++ and changing a few
detail to try to get execution time under control.

## Stem maps
A stem map file is a text file contain information for each tree detected in a scan. Each line is : x_position y_position z_position DBH.
I found that Computree was the best tool for generating a stem map from a scan, but feel free to generate it using other software.

## Usage

### Parameters
### Shell script and registration reports
